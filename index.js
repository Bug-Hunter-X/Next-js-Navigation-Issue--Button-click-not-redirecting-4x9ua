The issue is usually caused by not importing the necessary modules or incorrect usage of the routing functions.  The solution involves ensuring that `useRouter` is correctly imported and used, and that all relevant navigation functions are working correctly.

```javascript
//pages/about.js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

export default function About() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/'); // Navigate back to the home page
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About Page</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go back to Home</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
In this case, the code was correct and the problem might be related to other parts of your codebase that may interfere with this.  If the issue persists after checking the `useRouter` hook, you need to check your whole Next.js application for other possible conflicts.
